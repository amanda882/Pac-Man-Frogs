    <h2>Housing and Behaivor</h2>  
    <p> Pac-Man frogs are sit-and-wait predators. They spend most of their time burrowed unto substratewuth their eyes 
    (and sometime horns, depending on species)above the substrate. Because of this, their cage does noot need to be spacious. 
    Babies can be kept in small terrariums, but, adults need to be caged in terrariums that are 10-20 gallons. Pac-Man frogs
    love to burrow. Therefore they require a substrate that they can dig in to. Coir (ground coconut) makes a great substrate and
    its available at most pet stores. This substrate should remain damp, but not soaking wet. Many people recommend keeping a 
    water bowl in with the Pac-Man frog. Many have kept Pac-Mans with and without water bowls. As long as you keep the 
    substrate moist, a water bowl isnt a necessity. Pac-Man frogs will also use hiding spots, so they should be provided. Live plants, such as
    Pothos, not only provide hiding spots but also help to process feces and CO2. House pac-mans at 75 to 85 F. Keep Pacmans 
    as a solitary frog (1 per tank). They are aggressive eaters and can sometimes nibble on tank mates. Live Pac-Man frogs are
    sometimes mistaken for dead Pac-Man frogs. When their substrate dries out and/or food is scarce, the Pac-Man will encase itself 
    in a tough outer skin to protect it from drying out. They wont move and they look like they are dead. Once rehydrated, however,
    they will shed this outer skin (and eat it!).</p>
                

    <h2>Size</h2>
    <p>Most captive-bred baby Pac-Man frogs are sold at around the size of a quarter, and these frogs can reach adult size in one to one 
    and a half years. Adult males are smaller (2Â½ inches to 4 inches in length depending on the species) than female Pac-Man frogs, 
    which can reach lengths of 4 inches to 7 inches.</p>
       
    
    <h2>Life Span</h2>
            <p>Under optimal conditions, Pac-Man frogs can live approximately 15 years in a captive environment.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>One quality that sets Pac-Man frogs apart from other frogs is their voracious appetite. A staple of crickets and/or roaches is best, 
    but they can also eat fish, worms and even small mice. The amount of food you feed them is based on the size and temperature of 
    the frog. If allowed to cool down and dry out a little bit, Pac-Man frogs can enter a brumation state where they will refuse food.
    The best gauge for how much to feed your Pac-Man frog is to study your Pac-Man frog appearance. You want your Pac-Man to be round.
    If your frog is looking unnaturally large, cut back on the feeding. In nature Pac-Man frogs gorge themselves when food is plentiful 
    to compensate for when food is scarce. Make sure you are dusting your pac man frog food with an appropriate vitamin/mineral supplement.</p>
       
    <h2>Handling and Temperament</h2>
    <p>Pac-Man frogs have teeth, and large Pac-Man frogs can and will draw blood if you stick your hand in front of them. As with all frogs, 
    handling should occur only when absolutely necessary, as their skin is very sensitive.</p>
       
    <h2>Species and Morphs</h2>
    <p>There are 8 different species of Pac Man Frogs, however, there are so many morphs...</p>
    <p> Examples: Horned Pac-Man Frogs, Albino Pac-Man Frogs, Brown Pac-Man Frogs, Blue Pac-Man Frogs, Green Pac-Man Frogs,
    Chocolate Pac-Man Frogs, Strawberry Pac-Man Frogs, Translucent Pac-Man Frogs, Yellow Pac-Man Frogs, And so many more.. </p>
